                    <p>Hello, my name is Kirill. I'm a web-developer and work in this sphere for 3 years already. Besides front-end, some years I've been working as a full-stack developer. As for back-end development, I learnt C# and PHP and even have some project using this languages. And ofcourse SQL and databases. But for now I dicided to go deeper to front-end development.
											Every person likes to see the result of his or her work. That's why I'm very hardworking person and like to create something new. I like to make people happy, when I help them with something. I always try to satisfy customer and we have some meetings together discussing disign and content of customer's web-site before starting a web-site development. During all the time of development a customer has an opportunity to follow all the process and bring some modifications to the project.                            
											If you are interesting in cooperation with me you can easily find me in the links bellow or send me an email throw the contact form.</p>
